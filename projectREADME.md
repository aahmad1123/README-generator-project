# README-generator-project
README generator using node.js. I worked on this project with my tutor, Robert Kurle Jr., on February 23,2024. After installing inquirer, we first worked on the file writing function located in the index.js, then started adding the questions that inquirer would ask when running the index.js through node. Then we worked on the generateMarkdown file and inputted functions that would render licenses and create a table of contents for the sections of the README created by the index.js file writing function. Finally I created a video walkthrough going over each step of the application and showcasing the README generated by the app.

here is a link to the video showcase for the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbZVib9pBrcqyvoZalbZBEdsJbSUQUvt/view?usp=drive_link
